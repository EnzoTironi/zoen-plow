# The Agent Index usage reporter, fetched at build from an immutable commit and
# checked against its hash. Fetched rather than committed because
# plow-pbc/agent-index-client owns that file; a sha rather than a branch because
# this runs inside an agent holding a live credential, and a moving reference
# would substitute unreviewed code under it. The checksum is the second half: a
# sha in a URL is only as good as the host serving it. Bumping either is an edit
# somebody reviews.
#
# Root-owned, outside the state volume the agent writes: a copy the agent could
# write is a copy a turn can replace.
